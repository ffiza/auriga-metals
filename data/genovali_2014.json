    "Notes": "The current data set covers a range in Galactocentric distances of more than 10 kpc (4 <= RG <= 15 kpc). We estimated the metallicity gradient (dashed line) and we found [Fe/H] = 0.49 +/- 0.03 âˆ’ 0.051 +/- 0.003 RG / kpc. The new slope and zero-point agree quite well with similar estimates available in the literature (Luck & Lambert 2011; Lemasle et al. 2013)."
