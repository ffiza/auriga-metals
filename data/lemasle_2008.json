    "Notes": "The 63 stars of this sample are located between 8 and 15 kpc from the Galactic center (see Fig. 3). We investigated at first the working hypothesis of a linear gradient and calculated the iron Galactic gradient using the entire Cepheid sample. We found a slope of â€“0.023 +/- 0.007 dex/kpc that is shallower than previous studies."
