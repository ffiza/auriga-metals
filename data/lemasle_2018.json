    "Notes": "With the bootstrap method, we obtain a slope of −0.0447 +/- 0.0066 dex/kpc for the gradient (see Fig. 6). [...] The agreement remains reasonable with the total least squares method (Fig. 8), which gives a (shallower) slope of –0.040 +/- 0.002 dex/kpc. The range in radius goes from R_G ~ 6 kpc to R_G ~ 14 kpc."
